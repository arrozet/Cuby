# Cuby

## What is it about?
Cuby is a minimalistic 2D platform game starring a black and white cube. The game consists of single-room levels, where a key mechanic is color inversion. The cube can switch between black and white, altering the room’s layout. In a world where perception is everything, Cuby's ability to invert colors reshapes reality itself: with every switch, new paths emerge, obstacles disappear... All to achieve the ultimate goal: reunite Cuby with the Cubo family, torn from its very vertices by the evil Tetrahedron Association.
